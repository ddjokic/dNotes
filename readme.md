<h3> Notes - wnote and pnotes </h3>

At home, I am using exellent nvAlt. However, I developed complicated naming system and, to be honest, I am not great "typist". </p>

To help me in maintaining my laizines, I made two very similar scripts, which are dealing with filenames by creating files in hard coded folder, inserting tags as first line of the new file and open file in default text editor. Nothing spectacular, really. </p>

Reason for having two scripts is that path of notes are hardcoded - depends if note is work - related and/or something I may want to keep for future reference, once this project is finished. </p>

Script wnote_tags.py is going through all work-related notes (@ home I am using "nvALT", anyways) and displaying tag counts. Script is reading first line of the note file, only - be consistent in your note taking. </p>

It should work on all three systems - checked on Mac OSX and Windows 7. Windows users should edit path to be something like "C:\\\Path\\To\\\notes". <b>Double "back slash"!</b></p>

As always, you are using it on your own risk. </p>
